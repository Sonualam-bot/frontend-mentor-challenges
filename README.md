### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The Challenge which i faced while coding this component was the use of tailwind css to handle the responsiveness of the application. And the use of flexbox property to turn the design the into rows to cols direction was pretty handy. Finally practiced how to maintain the screen size and responsive on different screens.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on building complex design and hone the design skills not only with pure css but also master tailwind css in the process.
